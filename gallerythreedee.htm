Here is a gallery of some of the gadgets I've made in 3D-Desmos.
<br>
 Press the left arrows in each window to hide the toolbar. I haven't figured out how to get to minimize upon loading yet.

<b><a href="https://www.desmos.com/3d/fhjpa55sii" target="_blank">Regulus on a Hyperboloid</a></b>

A quadric surface (for example, a hyperboloid) supports two reguli: a family of disjoint lines that cover the quadric surface!
	<p>A quadric surface is an example of a ruled surface, meaning it admits a map π to some curve C (in this case, C is a quadric curve) where the fibers are each P^1, and π admits a section from C back to the surface.</p>

This is a (10,12)-geproci configuration of 120 points in P^3_C, as explored in this paper by Chiantini, Farnik, Favacchio, Harbourne, Migliore, Szemberg, and Szpond. All the points of this configuration are real, but 21 are at the plane at infinity, so only 99 are visible. This is a (120_4,80_6)-configuration, but 4 of the 80 lines are in the plane at infinity, so only 76 are visible.

This is a surface induced by the elliptic fibration spanned by the polynomials x^3+y^3+z^3 and xyz-y^2z. Its Mordell-Weil group is isomorphic to Z_6 x Z_6, but only two of its 36 sections are visible.

This is a surface induced by the elliptic fibration spanned by the polynomials x^3-xz^2 and (y-1)^2(y+1). It is non-extremal: its Mordell-Weil group is infinite. The three red lines are the sections corresponding to the exceptional divisors of the blowup, and the three orange lines are (-2)-curves. Its Dynkin diagram is D_4 + A_2.

 <p><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/3d/6633dfd75d?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 5px solid #af00af;border-radius:30px 30px 30px 30px;" frameborder=0></iframe></p>
A smooth cubic surface in P^3_C will have 27 lines, but not all of them will be real! This portrays the 12 real lines of the Clebsch cubic surface in A^3_R defined by the polynomial x^3+y^3+z^3+1=(x+y+z+1)^3. The Clebsch surface is special because it contains the maximal number of Eckardt points (points where three lines on the surface meet) of 10. Although, only four of them are real.

		<b><a href="https://www.desmos.com/3d/76ai57piya" target="_blank">The Hesse Pencil</a></b>

The Hesse pencil is the span of the polynomials x^3+y^3+z^3 and its Hesse derivative xyz in P^2. We can realize this pencil as a surface (in blue) in three-dimensional space by allowing the parameter to control the height. In silver, we see the fibers of the pencil, which are different linear combinations of x^3+y^3+z^3 and xyz. This elliptic surface is extremal, and the Mordell-Weil group is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3. Only two of its nine sections are visible here (in red). Its Dynkin diagram is Ã_2^4.

This is a surface induced by the elliptic fibration spanned by the polynomials x^3-xz^2 and y^3-yz^2. It is non-extremal: its Mordell-Weil group is infinite. The nine red lines are the sections corresponding to the exceptional divisors of the blowup, the four orange curves are examples of other sections in the Mordell-Weil group. Its Dynkin diagram is Ã_1^2 + Ã_2^2.
